Here’s a rephrased and slightly structured version of your **Circuit Crafter** project overview. I kept all information intact but polished the flow, grammar, and readability:

# CIRCUIT CRAFTER

**Circuit Crafter** is a web platform designed for **designing, publishing, categorizing, sharing, and saving circuits**, as well as **generating simulation files**. The platform simplifies experimentation for students, hobbyists, and engineers by providing ready-to-use circuit models and tools, eliminating the need to start from scratch.

## Key Features

### Circuit Designing (Main Feature)

* Users can browse existing circuit models (e.g., **instrumentation amplifier**) on the website.
* Logged-in users can:

  * Select a model.
  * View its **specifications** (e.g., amplification range, input type), **prerequisite components** (e.g., potentiometer), and **description**.
  * Input their own requirements (e.g., desired gain).
  * Generate and download an **LTSpice simulation file**.

---

### Circuit Models

Circuit models are **collections of standard circuits** useful for project work. Each model includes:

* Designing strategy
* Category
* Description
* Specifications
* Prerequisite components

Users can:

* View published models.
* Filter by category (e.g., amplifier, filter, etc.).
* Sort by likes, design count, upload time.
* Like, save, share, or design models.

**Adding a Circuit Model**

* Users with knowledge of a circuit design strategy can contribute a model by submitting:

  * Model name, description, category
  * Circuit file (with default values for calculation components, e.g., resistance)
  * Preview image
  * Design parameters (e.g., amplification) with upper & lower limits
  * Calculation components (e.g., Rin, Rf)
  * Formulas linking parameters and components (e.g., Rin=1000, Rf=-amplification\*Rin)
  * Specifications
  * Prerequisites (if any)

* **Approval Workflow**:

  * Submitted models enter a **pending state** (not published/visible).
  * Admin reviews and approves/rejects the model.
  * Once approved, the model becomes publicly available for design.
  * Owners/Admins can always edit or delete their models.
  * Admins may unapprove or reject models at any time.
  * If rejected, the user must edit and resubmit.

### Components

Components are **standard circuit elements** used in some models that are not available in LTSpice by default.

* To design models requiring such components, users must **download and save the component files** locally before viewing the generated simulation file.
* Users can view all available components in the **Resources page**.
* While creating a model that needs additional components:

  * The user must link to existing components or create new ones during the final step.
  * Once the model is approved, the linked components are also approved and become publicly available.
* **Delete Access**: Component deletion is allowed for its owner or the admin.

---

### Community & Notifications

* Users can create posts to share queries or information.
* Posts can:

  * Tag other users (with contribution count > 0), models, or custom tags.
  * Have **visibility settings**:

    * Private (visible only to tagged users and the post creator).
    * Public (visible to all).
  * Have **post type**: query or information.
* Other users can **share, view, like, and comment** on posts.
* Posts can only be deleted by their owner or the admin.

**Model Rejection Workflow in Community**:

* When a model is rejected, a private post is automatically created, tagging the model and its owner.
* User and admin can communicate via comments on that post regarding the approval process.

**Post Management**:

* Users can filter or search posts while browsing.

---

### Other Features

* Users can view:

  * Their own created models.
  * Saved models separately.
* **Notifications**: integrated with all activities (e.g., model status updates, community interactions).
* **Dark/Light Mode** toggle.
* **Creator’s Contact** options.
* Account management: logout, delete account, view last generated file.
* **Resources page** to guide users in utilizing the platform.
* Fully **responsive design**, optimized for both desktops and mobile devices.
